Besides, their writers say,\n[p]King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,\n[p]Did, as heir general, being descended\n[p]Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,\n[p]Make claim and title to the crown of France.\n[p]Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown\n[p]Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male\n[p]Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,\n[p]To find his title with some shows of truth,\n[p]'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,\n[p]Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,\n[p]Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son\n[p]To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son\n[p]Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,\n[p]Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,\n[p]Could not keep quiet in his conscience,\n[p]Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied\n[p]That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,\n[p]Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,\n[p]Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:\n[p]By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great\n[p]Was re-united to the crown of France.\n[p]So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.\n[p]King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,\n[p]King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear\n[p]To hold in right and title of the female:\n[p]So do the kings of France unto this day;\n[p]Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law\n[p]To bar your highness claiming from the female,\n[p]And rather choose to hide them in a net\n[p]Than amply to

If I could win a lady at\n[p]leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my\n[p]armour on my back, under the correction of bragging\n[p]be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.\n[p]Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse\n[p]for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and\n[p]sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,\n[p]Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my\n[p]eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;\n[p]only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,\n[p]nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a\n[p]fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth\n[p]sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love\n[p]of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy\n[p]cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst\n[p]love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee\n[p]that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the\n[p]Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou\n[p]livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and\n[p]uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee\n[p]right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other\n[p]places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that\n[p]can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do\n[p]always reason themselves out again. What! a\n[p]speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A\n[p]good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a\n[p]black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow\n[p]bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax\n[p]hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the\n[p]moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it\n[p]shines bright and never changes, but keeps his\n[p]course truly. If thou would have such a one, take\n[p]me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,\n[p]take a king.
