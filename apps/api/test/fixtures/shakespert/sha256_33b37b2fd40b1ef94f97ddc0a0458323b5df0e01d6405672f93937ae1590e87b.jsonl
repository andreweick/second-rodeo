shown,\n[p]Made me think upon mine own.\n[p]Ah, thought I, thou mourn'st in vain!\n[p]None takes pity on thy pain:\n[p]Senseless trees they cannot hear thee;\n[p]Ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee:\n[p]King Pandion he is dead;\n[p]All thy friends are lapp'd in lead;\n[p]All thy fellow birds do sing,\n[p]Careless of thy sorrowing.\n[p]Even so, poor bird, like thee,\n[p]None alive will pity me.\n[p]Whilst as fickle Fortune smiled,\n[p]Thou and I were both beguiled.\n[p]Every one that flatters thee\n[p]Is no friend in misery.\n[p]Words are easy, like the wind;\n[p]Faithful friends are hard to find:\n[p]Every man will be thy friend\n[p]Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend;\n[p]But if store of crowns be scant,\n[p]No man will supply thy want.\n[p]If that one be prodigal,\n[p]Bountiful they will him call,\n[p]And with such-like flattering,\n[p]'Pity but he were a king;'\n[p]If he be addict to vice,\n[p]Quickly him they will entice;\n[p]If to women he be bent,\n[p]They have at commandement:\n[p]But if Fortune once do frown,\n[p]Then farewell his great renown\n[p]They that fawn'd on him before\n[p]Use his company no more.\n[p]He that is thy friend indeed,\n[p]He will help thee in thy need:\n[p]If thou sorrow, he will weep;\n[p]If thou wake, he cannot sleep;\n[p]Thus of every grief in heart\n[p]He with thee doth bear a part.\n[p]These are certain signs to know\n[p]Faithful friend from flattering foe.","text_phonetic":" AS IT FL UPN A T IN 0 MR MN0 OF M STNK IN A PLSNT XT HX A KRF OF MRTLS MT BSTS TT LP ANT BRTS TT SNK TRS TT KR ANT PLNTS TT SPRNK EFR
